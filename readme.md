In this comprehensive tutorial, I will walk you through the step-by-step process of creating a custom MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework using PHP. This video is perfect for anyone who wants to understand the inner workings of a PHP framework and build their own from scratch!

What You'll Learn:

🌟 Request and Response Objects

Learn how to handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses back to the client. We'll build robust Request and Response classes to manage this crucial part of the framework.

🌟 Building the Kernel

The Kernel is the heart of your MVC framework and is responsible for managing the flow of requests and dispatching them to the correct controllers. We’ll show you how to build it from the ground up.

🌟 Creating Controllers

Controllers are where your application logic lives. We’ll demonstrate how to structure your controllers and route requests to the right actions.

🌟 Working with Models

Learn how to handle data in your application using models. We’ll create a simple ORM (Object Relational Mapping) system to interact with a database.

🌟 Building Views

Finally, we'll cover creating dynamic views using PHP templates to display data on your web pages.

By the end of this video, you'll have your own fully functional MVC framework in PHP, and you’ll have a deeper understanding of the inner workings of PHP web development. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an intermediate developer wanting to enhance your skills, this video is for you.
